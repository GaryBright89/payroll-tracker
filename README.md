# payroll-tracker

## Payroll Tracker a user can input employee information to log into a chart. This will also provide an average salary of all the salaries 
  the user input. A random employee also is given to allow any drawings or random choices that need to be made. The input starts by asking 
  how many employees you are inputing to allow the user to track how many they are inputting from the start.

## This page allows the user to input employee information and recieve a chart based on that input. Different features could be added in   
  the future to achieve similar but tweaked results.
